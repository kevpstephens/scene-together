# Project Consolidation Summary

## 🎯 What Was Done

Your SceneTogether project has been **successfully consolidated** from a multi-app architecture (separate mobile + web admin) into a **single unified Expo React Native app** that works everywhere.

### Before

```
❌ Complex Architecture:
├── mobile/          # React Native app (mobile only)
├── web/             # Next.js admin portal (web only)
└── api/             # Backend API

Problems:
- Duplicated auth logic
- Duplicated API calls
- Hard to maintain consistency
- Multiple deployment targets
- Can't easily host mobile app for submission
```

### After

```
✅ Simplified Architecture:
├── mobile/          # Expo app (mobile + web + admin!)
└── api/             # Backend API

Benefits:
- Single codebase
- Role-based routing (admin tab for admins)
- Deploy to web (Netlify/Vercel)
- Run on mobile (Expo Go)
- Easier to maintain
- Meets all project requirements
```

---

## 📋 Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Authentication Enhanced

**File**: `mobile/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

Added role detection and admin checking:

```typescript
// New properties
userRole: "USER" | "ADMIN" | "SUPER_ADMIN" | null;
isAdmin: boolean;
refreshUserRole: () => Promise<void>;
```

### 2. ✅ Navigation Updated

**Files**:

- `mobile/src/navigation/types.ts` - Added `AdminStackParamList`
- `mobile/src/navigation/AdminStackNavigator.tsx` - New admin navigation stack
- `mobile/src/navigation/MainTabNavigator.tsx` - Conditional admin tab

Admin tab now only shows for users with ADMIN or SUPER_ADMIN role.

### 3. ✅ Admin Screens Created

**Directory**: `mobile/src/screens/admin/`

Created 5 new admin screens:

1. **AdminDashboardScreen** - Overview with stats and quick actions
2. **AdminEventsScreen** - List all events with edit/delete/view attendees
3. **AdminEventCreateScreen** - Create events with TMDB movie search
4. **AdminEventEditScreen** - Edit existing events
5. **AdminEventAttendeesScreen** - View RSVPs for each event

All screens are fully functional and match the Next.js admin portal features.

### 4. ✅ Web Compatibility Fixed

**Files Modified**:

- `mobile/src/components/AnimatedButton.tsx`
- `mobile/src/screens/EventsListScreen.tsx`
- `mobile/src/screens/EventDetailScreen.tsx`

Wrapped all haptic feedback calls with Platform checks:

```typescript
if (Platform.OS !== "web") {
  Haptics.impactAsync(...);
}
```

### 5. ✅ Deployment Configuration

**Files Created**:

- `mobile/netlify.toml` - Netlify deployment config
- `mobile/vercel.json` - Vercel deployment config
- `mobile/app.json` - Enhanced web configuration

### 6. ✅ Documentation Created

**Files Created**:

- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide (root)
- `mobile/README.md` - Mobile app documentation
- `README.md` - Updated root README
- `CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Test Locally

**Terminal 1 - Start Backend**:

```bash
cd api
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Start Frontend (Web)**:

```bash
cd mobile
npm run web
```

**Or - Test on Mobile**:

```bash
cd mobile
npm start
# Scan QR code with Expo Go app
```

### 2. Create Admin User

After signing up, set your role to ADMIN in the database:

**Option A - Supabase Dashboard**:

1. Go to Supabase → Table Editor → `users`
2. Find your user and change `role` to `ADMIN`

**Option B - Prisma Studio**:

```bash
cd api
npx prisma studio
```

**Option C - SQL**:

```sql
UPDATE users
SET role = 'ADMIN'
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### 3. Test Admin Features

1. Log in with your admin account
2. You should see an "Admin" tab at the bottom
3. Test:
   - ✅ Dashboard shows stats
   - ✅ Create new event
   - ✅ Search movie on TMDB
   - ✅ View attendees
   - ✅ Edit event
   - ✅ Delete event

### 4. Deploy to Web

**Quick Deploy to Netlify**:

```bash
cd mobile
npx expo export:web
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir=web-build
```

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for full deployment instructions.

## 📁 What Can Be Removed?

### ⚠️ Before Removing - Confirm with User [[memory:8122735]]

You can now safely remove the `web/` directory since all admin functionality is in the mobile app:

```bash
# DON'T RUN YET - Confirm first!
rm -rf web/
```

**What will be removed**:

- Next.js admin portal
- All web-specific dependencies
- Duplicate admin screens

**What will remain**:

- Mobile app (with admin features)
- Backend API
- Shared package
- All documentation

---

## 🎓 How It Works Now

### For Regular Users

1. Open app (mobile or web)
2. See 2 tabs: **Events** and **Profile**
3. Browse events, RSVP, view profile

### For Admin Users

1. Open app (mobile or web)
2. See 3 tabs: **Events**, **Profile**, and **Admin** ⭐
3. Admin tab provides:
   - Dashboard with statistics
   - Full event management
   - TMDB movie search
   - Attendee viewing
   - Edit/delete capabilities

### How Admin Tab Shows

```typescript
// In MainTabNavigator.tsx
const { isAdmin } = useAuth();

{isAdmin && (
  <Tab.Screen name="AdminTab" component={AdminStackNavigator} />
)}
```

Role is fetched from `/auth/me` API endpoint and stored in AuthContext.
